Dictionary

Motivation: I have been started developing this dictionary on my own purpose. Because my native language is Hungarian, when I read english texts, especially literatures, there are words which I don't understand. So I often used Google Transle translate words and Google Docs to save these words for later usage. I realized this isn't the best way to translate and store these words. I made this dictionary where I can translate, store and to look back, already stored words. I store in database the english word, the hungarian counterpart, the part of speech and optionally one ore more synonyms and examples.

Features: The webapp can translate english to hungarian and vice versa. Because it uses online database for translation, if there is no internet connection, this feature is disabled. There's a table where you can read through your already stored words and you have a dynamic filter, with what you can filter on everything given in the table. If there is a word, which you translated using this app and it isn't in your database, just type in the word in the Addition section and store it in your database.
